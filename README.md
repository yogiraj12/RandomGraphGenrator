# RandomGraphGenrator
It Generates random graph using various algorithm,then these random graph is converted to various graph formats of our interest as .tg,.xml,.d,timed automata formats taken by verification tools,Kronos,Uppaal,Red respecively,in order to study the performance of these tools.It also generate game graph,weighted graph,probabilistic graphs.
